============= Karma Virtual Machine Monitor ================

Karma is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) designed to efficiently run Linux in a
virtual machine on top of the Fiasco.OC microkernel. It's design focused on
simplicity and efficiency. To that end, it does not implement any emulation of
any device, but resorts to paravirtualization.

Karma requires hardware assisted CPU virtualization, e.g. SVM for AMD CPUs or
VT for Intel CPUs. It can make use of hardware assisted memory virtualization
(Nested Paging or ePT), if available.

Karma was created during the diploma thesis of Steffen Liebergeld. You may find
his thesis in the directory ./doc/. Memory virtualization has been added by Jan
Nordholz during his diploma thesis, and Divij Gupta during his internship in
Berlin, both texts be found in ./doc/. The Karma VMM is currently being used as
a research vehicle at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin.

====== Requirements ========================================

* L4Re and Fiasco.OC are tested to build on Ubuntu 10.04.

* Fiasco.OC rev 38 (get it here http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/)
* L4Re      rev 38 (get it here http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/L4Re/)

Machine Specs
* CPU with hardware assisted CPU virtualization (SVM for AMD, VT for Intel)
* 32bit system


======= Building =============================================

* Get L4Re and Fiasco.OC

$ mkdir ~/l4re
$ svn cat http://svn.tudos.org/repos/oc/tudos/trunk/repomgr | perl - init http://svn.tudos.org/repos/oc/tudos fiasco l4re_snapshot

* Configure Fiasco.OC

$ mkdir ~/l4re/build/
$ cd ~/l4re/src/kernel/fiasco
$ make BUILDDIR=~/l4re/build/fiasco
$ cd ~/l4re/build/fiasco
$ make menuconfig

* Be sure to enable Virtualization Support.

* Build Fiasco.OC

$ cd l4re/build/fiasco
$ make

* Build L4Re.

$ cd ~/l4re/src/l4
$ make B=~/l4re/build/l4re
$ make O=~/l4re/build/l4re config
$ make

* Download and build Karma.

$ cd ~/l4re/src/l4/pkg/
$ git clone git://git.karma-vmm.org/karma-vmm karma
$ cd ~/l4re/src/l4
$ make O=~/l4re/build/l4re S=karma

* Download and build Linux for Karma.

$ cd ~/l4re/src/
$ git clone git://git.karma-vmm.org/karma-linux -b karma_3.3.5 linux
$ cd ~/l4re/src/linux
$ make ARCH=i386 O=~/l4re/build/linux karma_defconfig
$ make ARCH=i386 O=~/l4re/build/linux -j 8

* Build an iso image for Qemu.

$ cd ~/l4re/build/l4re
$ make grub2iso E=karma MODULES_LIST=$HOME/l4re/src/l4/pkg/karma/config/modules.list.karma_qemu MODULE_SEARCH_PATH=$HOME/l4re/build/l4re:$HOME/l4re/build/fiasco:$HOME/l4re/src/l4/pkg/karma/config:$HOME/l4re/src/l4/pkg/io/config:$HOME/l4re/build/linux/arch/x86/boot


======= Running Karma ===========================================

Have a look at the example menu.lst for the modules needed. An example moe
config Script can be found in the ./config/ directory.

======= Running Karma in Qemu ==================================

* You need Qemu >= 0.15.0.

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom $HOME/l4re/build/l4re/images/karma.iso -boot c -serial stdio -cpu phenom,+svm -m 512
